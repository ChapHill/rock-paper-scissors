# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple re-creation of the classic game of rock, paper, scissors. 
The user will select one of the three choices and the computer will randomly choose as well. 
The rounds will continue until either the user or computer wins three games. Upon winning the third, the game resets to the first round.
